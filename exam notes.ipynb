The peak has a higher demand for all price levels than the off-peak. A \"firm peak\" situation is where the peak service has higher demand than the off-peak even if it pays for the shared capacity itself. In a \"shifting peak\" case, unless the off-peak is charged for capacity, its demand will exceed capacity."
