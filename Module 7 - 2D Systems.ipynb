    "Consider a transit system with infinite headways (i.e., demand is so high that frequency is really high) and no boarding or alighting time. The system accelerates instantaneously to $v_\\max$, so there's no stopping time penalty. People walk along a grid so that walk distance is given by the [Manhattan Distance](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Manhattan_distance) between two points. The city is square with sides $\\phi$ and area $R$, so that $\\phi^2=R$. Origins and destinations are distributed evenly around the city. We have made these assumptions to emphasize the simple facts of system geometry at a minimum of complication.\n",
