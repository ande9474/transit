    "# Sources of scale economies in transit\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the most obvious sources of economies of scale in transit? Probably those that arise from *sharing* some piece of equipment or infrastructure. When 100 people ride a bus, they can split the cost of compensating the driver over more people than if only 10 rode. But the point of this lecture is that scale economies also arise, less visibly, from a fact particular to urban passenger transportation: users' time is an input to the production of rides---just as much as steel and diesel fuel and drivers' wages are. \n",
    "\n",
    "Compare transit to another utility: water. Water service has significant *physical* scale economies. Still, everything relevant my transaction with the water company is taken care of on my water bill: I turn on the faucet, water comes out, and I get charged. But to ride a bus, on the other hand, I pay the bus fare *and also*\n",
    "\n",
    "+ walk to the station\n",
    "+ wait for the bus\n",
    "+ and ride on the bus for a while. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, among these time costs, *some* have a special property: they get smaller as more service is provided overall. This happens because transit service is not provided continuously across space and time; a bus or train arrives at particular times and at particular places. So when an agency provides more service overall, often it also provides service at new times and places. These new times and places might be closer to *when* I want to travel (meaning less wait time) or *where* I want to travel (meaning less walk time). The upshot is: *the more service is provided, the more convenient the service is.* This idea is called the \"Mohring effect\" because it was first made explicit by [Herbert Mohring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Mohring), an economist from of University of Minnesota.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we are going to look at a series of models that illustrate this idea. For simplicity, these are all models with **exogenous demand**; that is, the number of riders is fixed; it does not depend on quality or price."

    "+ $Q$ ridership (pax/hr )\n",
    "+ $W$ average wait time at the stop (hrs)\n",

    "where $QWc_w$ is the user's cost and $Fc_f$ is the agency's cost.\n",

    "Note the first term of this equation (aggregate wait time) is the same as it was before demand doubled! So twice as many people are riding the bus, but all in all they are waiting the same aggregate amount of time. The reason is that headways have been cut in half. Therefore, while demand grew 100%, total cost grew *less than* 100%. Therefore, the cost *per rider* (average social cost) fell."

To cut headway by 50%, you need 2x buses; to cut headway by 75%, you have to pay for *4x* as many buses.

But if the transit budget is fixed, spending more money on one transit project means cutting spending on other transit projects. These trade-offs, of course, don't imply you should cut a project's budget down to nothing. The alternative expenditures might not be as worthwhile as the one you're analyzing: some of what doctors, police and teachers do is utterly useless, and some of it is even actively harmful but happens anyway for political reasons.

It's just that in this model, $M$ represents service rather than $F$, and it scales faster than in the previous model. The reason is that increasing $M$ now does two jobs: it reduces wait times *and* walk times. $F$ itself scales more slowly than in the previous model, though, because, for a given $M$, increasing frequency means incerasing route spacing (and thus increasing walk times).\n",

They are really just more logically rigorous versions of Aesop's fables or Zen koans or ancient myths common in every culture. This isn't just true because our models involve people: in physics classes you learn about \"free body diagrams\" and \"frictionless surfaces,\" but no such things have ever existed nor ever will. In every engineering choice you make, you have to ignore some real facts. The trick is knowing what's relevant and how you can capture it in a pretty way that illuminates more than it obscures. For example, if you're designing an airplane, you can operate in the world of Newtownian physics: forces acting on the plane only accelerate it.
