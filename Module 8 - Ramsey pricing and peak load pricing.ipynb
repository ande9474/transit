    "# The problem: coming up with money to cover average costs\n",
    "\n",
    "Prices, systems of pricing and technologies of prices vary among transit systems as much as stop spacings and other design features we've looked at.  On the New York City subway, the same low fare takes you from Coney Island to Harlem or just a few blocks, whereas BART charges a unique (and high) price for almost every OD pair; and The London Underground has something in-between: a series of zones inside of which the fare is uniform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though pricing varies so much, most people think of pricing as an afterthought. It's almost as though the built is designed with no cost in mind, and then when the fun part is over we turn to pricing as some way to pay for it. But actually pricing is an essential aspect of the transit system, and it merits consideration from the beginning. It affects how many people are willing to ride, and where and at what time they ride, as much as the speed and headways.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\newcommand{\\pder}[2]{\\frac{\\partial#1}{\\partial#2}}$\n",
    "Pricing transit is different than pricing, say, corn, because as we've seen it's subject to enormous economies of scale. There are physical economies of scale, but also user cost economies of scale like the way headway declines. That makes it subject to different rules than other commodities more commonly provided by markets. That's important to note, because it relates to a common argument: transit opponents like to point that transit is subsidized, and they conclude it shouldn't be provided at all. The idea is that if customers aren't willing to cover the cost of the service then it's not efficient for the service to be provided---at least not in the amount the government provides. But this isn't necessarily true. In reality, since transit has large economies of scale, its pricing presents two problems: solvency and efficiency."

    "<img src=\"./img/prices-worthwhile.png\" width=\"40%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the demand curve $p(q)$ never intersects the average cost curve $ac(q)$. That means there is no price we can charge that will be as high as the average cost per rider at that price. In the figure, I've chosen the price that makes the most money possible, and it's still not high enough to cover costs. But it's still socially beneficial to operate the service with a small subsidy. To see why, note that at price $P$, the sum of consumer surplus and total revenue is given by the trapezoid $ABCO$. This area is bigger than total cost at price $P$, which is equal to the area of the rectangle $DECO$. Therefore, the service is socially efficient to provide (its benefits outweigh its costs for certain prices), but to provide it might require some kind of subsidy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just so you don't get the wrong idea, here is an example of a service whose demand is so low, relative to costs, that it is never worthwhile to provide. Even when price equals marginal cost, the service doesn't satisfy consumers enough to cover its costs. An example would be a bad movie: once it's created, the cost of someone streaming a bad movie online is roughly zero (unless you count the psychic damage to the viewer). But that doesn't mean the government should subsidize bad movies and offer them free online.\n",

    "# Strategies to come up with extra money\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to come up with extra money is taxes. We raise taxes on society at large and use them to invest in things with low marginal costs. Examples include uncongested roads and parks. Especially in a society like ours where a small fraction of people make enormous amounts of money or hold incredible sums of wealth, this isn't too bad of a way to go. And in the US, as it happens, transit is extremely heavily subsidized. But taxes have downsides: they encourage people to change their behavior to avoid taxes and add to costs in other industries. More practically, transportation engineers cannot magically raise taxes whenever they want. So, in the end, you have to work with a budget. What we are going to learn are different techniques to raise more revenues from your customers by pricing intelligently.\n",

    "# Peak-load pricing\n",
    "\n",
    "Another problem you'll face is that the same capacity can be used at different types of day, when demands are different. How do you choose how much capacity to supply? How do you price the peak and off-peak? The principles of what is called \"peak load pricing\" were first laid out by the economist [Peter Steiner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_O._Steiner). We'll unpack them in a simple model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $p_H(q)$ and $p_L(q)<p_H(q)$ be the peak and off-peak demand (high and low). Let $\\beta$ be the cost of capacity, and $c$ be the marginal operating cost of supplying a ride. So $\\beta$ might be the cost of the track, and $c$ would involve the costs of running a train. Let $K$ be the capacity you've supplied.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job is to choose the optimal capacity to supply. Once the capacity is supplied you have to choose prices to ration demand to that capacity, and to pay for that capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are basically two cases. The first case is where the peak demand is much higher than the off-peak demand and capacity isn't too expensive. Therefore, even if you make peak users pay for all the cost of capacity, off-peak users won't use all the capacity when they face price equal to marginal cost. This situation is shown below. If you charge $p_H = \\beta + c$, then the optimal capacity is given by the point where $p_H(K^*)=\\beta + c$. And even if you only charge $p_L = c$, off-peak users demand less than $K^*$ rides. This is called the \"firm peak\" case because the peak period is the same before and after pricing. It \"stays firm.\"\n",

    "The second case is where the peak and off-peak demands are pretty similar. In this case, if you charge the off-peak users only for their marginal costs, then off-peak demand will exceed capacity. An example is shown below. The way to find the optimal capacity in this case is to form an aggregated demand curve $p_{L+H}(q)=p_L(q)+p_H(q)$ and find where it intersects the line $\\beta + 2c$. Then you choose the price for each group that rations demand to $K^*$. For both groups, it will be greater than marginal cost, so both the peak and off-peak will contribute to capacity costs. We call this the \"shifting peak\" case because if you only charge the off-peak its marginal costs the off-peak will have more demand than the peak; that is, which period is the peak will \"shift.\"\n",
