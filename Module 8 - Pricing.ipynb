The idea is that if customers aren't willing to cover the cost of the service then it's not efficient for the service to be provided---at least not in the amount the government provides.

In the figure, I've chosen the price that makes the most money possible, and it's still not high enough to cover costs. But it's still socially beneficial to operate the service with a small subsidy. To see why, note that at price $P$, the sum of consumer surplus and total revenue is given by the trapezoid $ABCO$. This area is bigger than total cost at price $P$, which is equal to the area of the rectangle $DECO$. Therefore, the service is socially efficient to provide (its benefits outweigh its costs for certain prices), but to provide it might require some kind of subsidy.\n",

Especially in a society like ours where a small fraction of people make enormous amounts of money or hold incredible sums of wealth, this isn't too bad of a way to go. And in the US, as it happens, transit is extremely heavily subsidized. But taxes have downsides: they encourage people to change their behavior to avoid taxes and add to costs in other industries. More practically, transportation engineers cannot magically raise taxes whenever they want. So, in the end, you have to work with a budget. What we are going to learn are different techniques to raise more revenues from your customers by pricing intelligently.\n",

In this case, the value to riders of the service, when priced at marginal cost, outweighs its fixed cost. Therefore, if we sell a travel card for $f_0/N$ that lets riders buy rides at price $c$, then riders will take us up on the deal. So we will be able to price at marginal cost, and still cover all the fixed costs. The efficiency lost from average cost pricing is eliminated.\n",
